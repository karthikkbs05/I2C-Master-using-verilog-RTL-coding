- Serial Communication Protocol : I2C is an interface specification for synchronous serial data transfer, using a clock.
- Half/Full Duplex Suppor : I2C supports both half-duplex and full-duplex serial communication modes.
- Synchronous Communication : It is a synchronous communication protocol, utilizing a shared clock signal for synchronization.
- Two-Wire Communication Protocol: I2C is a two-wire protocol, consisting of a data line (SDA) and a clock line (SCL) for communication.
  - `Serial Data Line (SDA)`: SDA is used for bidirectional data transfer between the master and slave devices.
  - `Serial Clock Line (SCL)`: SCL provides the clock signal that synchronizes the data transfer between the master and slave devices.
- Master-Slave Configuration : In most cases, I2C follows a one-master-multiple-slaves protocol, but it also supports multiple master configurations.
- Maximum Speed : I2C supports maximum speeds of up to several Mbps, commonly ranging from 100 kbps (standard mode) to 3.4 Mbps (high-speed mode).
- Clock Source : The master device provides the clock signal for synchronization.
- Data Formats : I2C supports both 8-bit and 16-bit data formats for communication.
